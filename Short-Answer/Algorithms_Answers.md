#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) the while loop is looping while "a" is less "n^3" but inside of the loop it's adding "n^2" to "a" and "n^3 / n^2 = n" so it will loop "n" times" 


b) n times the greatest power of 2 that's less than n iterations


c) bunnyEars will call itself and pass "bunnies - 1" until "bunnies" reaches 0, so it the function will recur "bunnies + 1" times

## Exercise II
